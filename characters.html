              <div id = "Edith"></div>
              <h3>Edith Corksling</h3>
              <p>
                  As a young wood elf Edith always wanted to cook. Before his parents were divorced food was how his family bonded,
                  little did he know it was simply out of necessity for them. After his parents divorced Edith continued learning how to
                  cook from his dad Jogger, who he lived with from then on. School started and he chose a cooking class over the usual
                  P.E. and boy did he get good at it. He brought home pastas, pastries, and his favorite, braised beef, and minced pea
                  soup.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Life was good despite his parents divorce, that was until the week after his 13th birthday. Edith had come to fancy a
                  high elf in his cooking class as all young boys do, Parker, and he wanted to bake her a few cupcakes. His usual care
                  was put into the prep but while his pastries cooked he daydreamed over the girl. The oven ran for 20 minutes past what
                  it was supposed to. The fire took to the rafters of the school before anyone even realized where it came from.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Six kids died that day, including Parker, and Edith hasn’t cooked since. His anxiety around fire and cooking persists,
                  the one thing that dulls them is ironically burning a different kind of herb. His days of smoking led him to a level
                  of enlightenment only high monks can reach. The way of The Stoned Master.

              <div id = "Vincent"></div>
              <h3>Vincent</h3>
              <p>
                  Reigning from Duon, Vincent was a child in a very underdeveloped town. Overpopulated and under resourced, housing was
                  stacked vertically and packed very tight. Vincent was raised in an orphanage where he would often fight for food and
                  necessities. They would regularly go into an “arena” to fight one another and be bet upon. Vincent would work as a
                  medic, helping cure some of the ailments of children who made it back, which got him into medicine. He would always
                  experiment with new ways of healing on himself and little creatures he found.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Eventually with enough time, and help from a friend, he escaped and fled into an old abandon museum where he donned
                  his now everyday attire. An old plague doctors cloak, with the mask to match.
                  <br/><br/>
                  He then went off on his own and continued to help people where he could and continue his experiments until he came
                  across Ellcom. Seeing an opportunity to make change, and make some money, he joined up and the rest is history.
                  <br/><br/>

              <div id = "Anima"></div>
              <h3>Anima Flore</h3>
              <p>
                  A native of Terterra, Anima reigns from the Village Scythia - a lush coastal village home to the Swarmkeepers. Anima
                  and his family tended to the insects and flora around their village and throughout the forest, maintaining
                  sustainability and safety of both the villagers and the wildlife.
                  <br/><br/>
                  As a child Anima's father, one of the original Blades, would tell him stories of all sorts of adventures, but he only
                  spoke of his time in the Blades once. His father hoped for Anima to not make the same mistakes as he did.
                  <br/><br/>
                  As Anima became a young adult he took responsibility as keeper to help take the burden off of his parents. They lived
                  out their remaining years peacefully before passing on into Helm's embrace. Anima's connection with then never waned,
                  and they remain together, bound by the bugs they swore to protect.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Long after their passing Anima was content, he was a well-respected person throughout the village and Scythia was
                  prospering. This peace however would soon fall to The Eternal Twilight. Monsters from a dark realm crawled from the
                  ground, the dead that Anima had helped bury rose to drag him under. He picked up the mantle of Blade, and set out to
                  stop the one behind his village's destruction.
                  <br/><br/>

              <div id = "Lyren"></div>
              <h3>Lyren</h3>
              <p>
                  Lyren, despite his nature as a healer, has known more death than most… A large portion of which was dealt by his own
                  hands. His father distilled into him from a young age, with the intent of easing his sorrows over the death Lyren
                  witnessed, that those who died deserved it.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Lyren grew into a drunkard like his father, and eventually a brawler due to his large size and lack of inhibitions.
                  From here he was recruited into the Trion Army, a group of mercenaries for hire to the highest bidder. Blow after
                  blow, slash after slash, Lyren became a skilled fighter, and an even better killer. “Doing the job that should be
                  done” his sergeant would always say.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Not all of his kills were just, and while he has come to terms with most, there are a few that still threaten to crawl
                  from within their caves deep in his memories. For now, Lyren does what he can to keep these forgotten memories
                  forgotten, while he searches for vengeance for his late brother Fellwren.
                  <br/><br/>
              </p>

              <div id = "Fellwren"></div>
              <h3>Fellwren</h3>
              <p>
                  Being the bastard is hard enough, but when your mother’s side of the family is the one from which you crave approval
                  it’s even harder. Fellwren was born of a secret night spent between a commoner and Iris Realmsweeper, the black haired
                  beauty of the all too famous family. After his birth Fellwren was dumped on his father Jerren, to live out his
                  childhood as a strange kid in the lounge of his fathers bar.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Be it his mothers success or his fathers failures, Fellwren craved more. He begged for acceptance from his maternal
                  side, forever stonewalled by Elias Realmsweeper at every attempt to join Ellcom. He wasn’t strong enough. He offered
                  nothing to the team. He was too weak.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Fellwren found a solution, the ticket to his families love, he simply needed to be useful to them. While his father
                  spent his nights tending to the urges of lesser men, the thieves and mercenaries of the greater Eview area, Fellwren
                  spent his deep in books. Ancient texts that made their way into his possession through some means or another detailed
                  ancient rites of power. Blood magic. His body corrupted and his soul potentially tainted for no reason other than the
                  glory of his family and the love of his mother, Fellwren finally had the power to be useful to Ellcom.
                  <br/><br/>
              </p>

              <div id = "Ea"></div>
              <h3>Ea Creed</h3>
              <p>
                  “Compound” is not the word that comes to mind when you picture a childhood home, but it was all Ea ever knew. She grew
                  up in the Sorcery Core, her innate capabilities for magic an invaluable asset to The Realmsweepers. The Compound was a
                  cold place, but not always a bad one, they rewarded progress, and Ea was full of it.
                  <br/><br/>
                  She never received the beatings the other kids did, as they failed test after test. She never could figure out what
                  they didn’t understand as for her magic was second nature. In an effort to stir up some good PR, and put their latest
                  program to the test, Ellcom’s star pupil Ea was sent to join the latest expansion project, Terterra.
                  <br/><br/>
                  She was tasked with assisting a team who lacked a dedicated caster, as well as a covert operation. Find and retrieve
                  this strange black metal, without the attention of prying eyes. It was of the utmost importance to The Realmsweepers.
                  <br/><br/>
