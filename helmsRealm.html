              <h2>Helm</h2>
              <h3>God of Death, Keeper of Peace</h3>
              <p>
                  Helm has been the eternal sentry and was always seen wearing a full suit of armor that represented the
                  weight of his heavy responsibility - the ending of life. As mortals grow old, and gain power, they
                  corrupt, the mortal soul was never meant to live an undying life. There are four planes in Helm's
                  Realm: The Nine Hells, Elysium, The Fugue Plane, and Limbo
                  <br/><br/>
              </p>

              <hr>

              <div id = "NineHells"></div>
              <h2>The Nine Hells</h2>
              <h3>A Place of War and Punishment</h3>
              <p>
                  “From the boiling rivers of fluid in Avernus to the sheer crags of Nessus, you'd be hard-pressed to
                  find a place that sums up the cold cruelty of the planes more than The Hells do.”
                  <br>
                  &emsp; - Nomoto Sinh, a subject decaying in Minauros
                  <br/><br/>
                  The Nine Hells (sometimes referred to as Baator) are a plane of sinister wickedness and institutional
                  cruelty, its denizens organized into a strict caste system with a very rigid chain of command. Each of
                  the nine Hells had its own physical laws or properties of matter, but all were inhospitable or deadly
                  to outsiders.
                  <br/><br/>
              </p>

              <div id = "Elysium"></div>
              <h2>Elysium</h2>
              <h3>Dying a Hero's Death</h3>
              <p>
                  “The path you travel doesn't matter. You can walk in a straight, orderly line, or race chaotically
                  this way and that. Just keep the place you want to get to in mind and start walking. As long as you do
                  good works along the way, you'll reach your destination.”
                  <br>
                  &emsp; - Rion, a shepherd of Elysium.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Elysium is a plane embodying the concept of pure good without being overly restricted by law nor
                  dissipated by the randomness of chaos. Any who have lived a righteous and proper life can end it here,
                  but the great heroes have a reserved seat.
                  <br/><br/>
              </p>

              <div id = "FuguePlane"></div>
              <h2>The Fugue Plane</h2>
              <h3>Caught Between Good and Evil</h3>
              <p>
                  "Should you get a chance to live your life over again, perhaps try something more interesting"
                  <br>
                  &emsp; - Kelemvor, a ruler of The Fugue Plane.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The Fugue Plane is home to the most in the middle of all souls. No allegiences pledged, no wars
                  fought, no crimes committed. Here they are offered a chance to plead their case and find their
                  permanent afterlife. The vast majority of this plane is flat, gray, bland and nondescript, with no
                  notable topographical features. The sky overhead is also gray. The plane's only significant feature is
                  The City of Judgment, in the middle of which stood The Crystal Spire where Kelemvor and Jergal reside
                  and rule.
                  <br/><br/>
              </p>

              <div id = "Limbo"></div>
              <h2>Limbo</h2>
              <h3>An Inconceivable Conundrum</h3>
              <p>
                  "Breathe the fire; Walk the air; Drink the earth; Warm your hands at the water."
                  <br>
                  &emsp; - A petitioner's greeting to Limbo.
                  <br/><br/>
                  This plane is supreme chaos, a twisting, quicksilver place filled with bits and pieces of rocks,
                  trees, the four elements, entire landscapes, strong winds, and random pockets of liquid, solid, or
                  gas. Sentient beings can dampen down the chaos to livable levels and produce a safe environment as
                  long as they maintain concentration. The size of a safe zone is directly related to the intelligence
                  of the individual controller.
                  <br/><br/><br/><br/>
