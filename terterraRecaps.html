              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>In a land of teleportation circles and plane shifting wizards, the logistics of space travel simply lose all
                  importance. As scholarly wizards and diviners scoured their planet for all that was to be found, their eyes turned to
                  the sky, reaching out to the stars with powerful arcane energy.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Oh, how they explored.
                  <br/><br/>
                  It is the year 3065 and life spans across three planets, linked together with teleportation circles scattered across
                  the world, controlled and operated by an organization known as Ellcom; the very mages who opened these doorways so
                  long ago. Our journey takes place on Terterra, the third world. Terterra is the youngest of the three planets, its
                  surface not fully explored, and its secrets yet to be uncovered. We follow the journey of Expansion Team 23 as they
                  set out to explore Terterra’s surface in search of habitable space and signs of sentient life.
                  <br/><br/></p>

              <div id = "Ellcom"></div>
              <h3>Session 1: Orientation</h3>
              <p>Session one was a bit of an intro, Team 23 got accustomed to their whereabouts, and went on the hunt for some wolf
                  like beings that had been tearing through Camp Malovia's food supplies. They quickly dispatched the dogs and headed
                  back to camp for a nice payday.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The Team met:</p>

              <p class="bullets">
                  - Booker: A sargent for Ellcom, and their boss.
                  <br/>
                  - Jillian: The remotely operated android that ran the market in camp
                  <br/>
                  - Urgra: The nurse who would supply Edith with weed for the coming weeks.
                  <br/>
                  - Chance: A fellow Ellcom employee who lost a friend on their first job.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 2: Raw Weave</h3>
              <p>Team 23 investigated a strange arcane signal, coming from somewhere to the North. Booker informed you that it seemed
                  to have the same energy signal as Raw Weave, something Ellcom would love to get their hands on. Your journey took you
                  into a small chunk of one of Terterra’s forests, where you fought off large alien wasps with ease. After journeying
                  further into the forest you came across a clearing filled fabulous shifting lights like that of an Aurora. Raw Weave.
                  As you began documenting, The Weave seemed to shift and bend creating a tornado of energy that you were forced to
                  fight off! Some documentation and investigation revealed that you were not the first to come through this clearing.
                  It seemed some of the trees in the area had been cleared out, could it be alien life? Our short session came to a
                  close with a handsome payday, as our team leveled up and headed off to bed.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 3: The Tiqa</h3>
              <p>Expansion Team 23 went off in search of the sentient life they thought they had found evidence of the night prior.
                  The Team headed out to the field of Raw Weave to do some investigating, where they heard giggling in the forest and
                  got the feeling they were being watched. After some serious survival checks and some Mach speed sprinting, the sounds
                  led you to a trail, deep deep into the woods. This trail turned out to be some sort of strange maze that wound back
                  and forth across confusing terrain through foggy woods, along which you found a seemingly inconsequential shard of
                  black metal that shone green in the sunlight. Eventually this trail led you into a clearing with six statues, each one
                  a representation of the six stats that make a great adventurer, and after a show of each characteristic the statues
                  bowed deeply to you and opened up a gateway to another realm. This was the realm of the Kreiss Clan, an offshoot of
                  the Tiqa people that hid themselves away with Mystra’s help, fearing that “Monsters from another realm were coming to
                  take over their world.” After some pleading from the village’s chief, you chose to keep the Tiqa’s secret, returning
                  to base and lying to your boss Booker, despite the possibility that your calling cards might have been tracking you,
                  and might have uploaded pictures of the Gate puzzle to Ellcom’s servers…
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 4: The Hunt</h3>
              <p>Booker gathered the four expansion teams and sent you all out on a hunt for the Alien race that was suspected to
                  be living in the forest. Team 21, an expert group of rangers and trackers was sent North, an area you knew to hold the
                  gate to the Tiqa’s realm. You all made haste to beat them there, tracking your way through the forest with Vincent
                  flying above you helping you navigate, a mid-flight prayer from our parties artificer gathered weave into a semi
                  corporeal form, as if Mystra herself was leading you right to the gate. You all beat team 21 and dove through to the
                  other side, warning Kita of the impending danger. The sadness on his face was clear as day, his people’s connection to
                  his home planet would be broken, but he swore to make it temporary, telling you they would find their way back to you.
                  You dove back through the foggy gateway, landing back on Terterran ground, to find yourself surrounded by Team 21.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Your disobedience was evident as this was not the quadrant you were intended to survey, and Team 21 sought to take
                  care of you. You were outnumbered, outgunned, and unlucky, but odds never bothered Team 23 much anyway. Vincent
                  fought half of the fight from the ground, barely hanging on to his life, while Ea played battle medic, launching
                  missiles and administering syringes. As Ea tried to finish off team 21, her magic spun out of control, dropping fire
                  on her allies and herself, and igniting the surrounding forest. Fellwren swooped in to carve away the last of their
                  foes, and the sprint home began. Some impressive magic and skill checks finally got you to safety, and the fire burned
                  away any and all evidence. Or so you believe…
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 5: Gambling Wuggy</h3>
              <p>You all accepted a job from Jillian, who informed you that you were in the lead in the Realmsweeper sweepstakes. It
                  was only slightly due to Team 21’s untimely demise… This job took you towards the coast, in search of precious cargo.
                  You traveled through a canyon, with falling rocks and strange furry creatures, one of which had an explosive mechanism
                  that magically fired projectiles in your direction. With the help of a magical horned horse, you managed to barely
                  stay alive, and reach your destination. On the coast you found the package that you were in search of, its carrier
                  ripped to shreds by something with large teeth. This package was magically protected, seemingly a time capsule or
                  cache of some sort, and within it you found a strange blade.

                  <br/><br/>
                  This blade was made of metal similar to some you have found in past, one on your path to the Tiqa, that has
                  mysteriously disappeared, and the other in the form of a blade hanging around the chief’s neck. Your path back was
                  uneventful, but led you deep into lies. The contents of the trunk were altered, each of you taking a cut of the gems,
                  as well as Fellwren hanging on to the blade within. The party spent the night uncovering a gambling ring, and testing
                  Lady Luck, as they made new friends and perhaps some gold bearing rivals.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 6: The Blades Dungeon</h3>
              <p>Three members of Team 23 fell into an incredibly restless sleep, having some sort of shared dream, or perhaps
                  nightmare? The three found themselves chasing after a young Tiqa child, who had stolen a weapon from one of the party
                  members. Fellwren seeing his sword planted deep into the ground in the canyons woke with a start to find the sword had
                  somehow vanished in the night, with their fourth member Edith watching the entirety of the night and seeing nothing.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The party set out for adventure once more, delving their way deep into the canyons to find this place and hopefully
                  their new weapon. Your journeys led you deep into a mysterious dungeon, with dangers and puzzles all around. After
                  some frustrating navigation and some near death dart trap encounters, you finally reached the end of this dungeon to
                  find a dark room lit only by a fireplace. Here a familiar face emerged. Chief Kita in his ornate traditional robes
                  greeted you with a smile and told you all of the great Blades.

                  <br/><br/>
                  When Mystra first warned of danger from the other worlds, the people of this planet were still united, and they bound
                  together to form a line of defense. Using a metal that Mystra herself scattered across the realms, they forged weapons
                  that could kill the undying. The tension however never came to a head and the people sought to fight one another
                  instead of keeping their eye on the future. As far as Kita knows he is the only surviving member of The Blades. Rather
                  than open the door to his realm again he led you to this dungeon to meet and give you the info you might need to
                  survive. There is a family where you come from, undying and unkillable made only by a dark perversion of Mystra’s
                  magic. The metal you all hold in your hands was Mystra’s last attempt to end the disgrace that is their existence.
                  Some say wielding an Adamantine blade is like holding a piece of Mystra’s body in and of itself.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 7: One Last Job</h3>
              <p>You received a memo from The Realmsweepers, the end of the sweepstakes was upon us, and you had time for one more
                  job! You had the lead in information gathered so Jillian sent you off for one more recon mission; what on Terterra
                  could have possibly taken out that drone?

                  <br/><br/>
                  Following the little information you found at the crash site, you deduced that it must have been something in the
                  direction of those offshore islands. Your artificer got to work putting together a makeshift raft, propelled by Ea’s
                  gusts, and steered with Vincents own wings. Your treacherous journey across the narrow stretch of ocean led you
                  through a pack of tentacled creatures much bigger that the ones you had seen a few weeks prior. Tentacles lashed out
                  at you from all directions, threatening to pull you off the boat and strangle the life from you. Your fight ended with
                  Vincent’s lifeless body being dragged underwater, only to be saved by a valiant dive from Edith, and a destructive
                  blow from Ea.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Injured, exhausted, and hungry for some grilled squid, you rested up and continued to shore. You discovered a race of
                  Lizardfolk that you had previously only heard of from Chance and his team. This tribe however did not dwell on land
                  but rather isolated on this island, making sacrifices and offerings to a minor dragon named Grong, in exchange for
                  his “protection”. Their leader Kax turned out to be a scorned ex member of the blades, presumed dead by Kita. You
                  slayed Grong, and in a surprising turn of character for this group spared Kax’s life after he promised to be there
                  when you one day needed him most. Carrying the lifeless head of their once worshipped “God” you departed from the
                  island and tuned into the sweepstakes livestream, anxious to see if you would have a chance to Meet The Realmsweepers.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 8: The Manor</h3>
              <p>Session eight was a celebration of Team 23’s achievements. The announcement rang out across the ocean’s of Terterra,
                  Team 23 would Meet The Realmsweepers. You travelled through the fabric of space thanks to Ellcom’s technology, landing
                  squarely in the middle of their headquarters. You spent the evening taking care of a few personal matters. Fellwren
                  visited his father, who still ran the same shady bar with the same amount of care as he always has… little to none… Ea
                  made an attempt to visit her old home, The Compound, which houses the sorcery core. The desk clerk denied her entry
                  much to her dismay, sympathizing with her traumatic childhood. Ea knew not of what he referenced. On his own mission
                  Vincent went in search of other Artificers, finding a company by the name of Arc-8, and leaving his number for them to
                  contact him.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The team set aside their own personal journeys for a bit however, to attend to their original plan. Meet The
                  Realmsweepers and see for themselves if they were truly evil. The trip to their Manor began well, everyone quickly got
                  settled in, and went out for some grub. Edith even overcame his fear of cooking, and gained a few new benefits. The
                  day could not all be grand however as it never is for Team 23. After talking to his dad and a few of the house
                  employees, Fellwren began to uncover something. No one had seen or heard from Iris Realmsweeper since his birth.
                  Dinner confirmed his suspicions as the only attendees were Elias, Astrid, and Gideon, the company faces.

                  <br/><br/>
                  He couldn’t wait until one on ones, Fellwren needed to know. He scoured over paintings which pointed to a secret code
                  phrase. “Undying.” As the door to Iris’s room clicked open Fellwren found her motionless body, restrained by Weave,
                  unwaveringly still. Guards descended and you fought them off, your friends rejoining you as you all sprinted through
                  the halls of the house. Tearing off out the front door, barely clinging on to your lives and your consciousness, one
                  stayed behind.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Hummus. Cold and alone beneath Iris’s bed. Elias’s words still ring in your head. “That bastard won't be the one to
                  undo this family” as you sprint bloodied and bruised away from the Realmsweeper Manor.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 9: When In Eview</h3>
              <p>We jumped into the action last session with the Team on the run from The Realmsweeper Manor, the guards pursuing with
                  a calm slow cadence. You quickly hopped in a cab and took off for the “safety” of Jerren’s Tavern. Of course a bar
                  that makes it living off of the vices of criminals can never be all that safe, and with your luck Jerren’s loan shark
                  picked now of all times to pay him a visit. You kicked his overconfident ass, scaring off one of his goons in the
                  process, and found shelter in the upstairs bedroom that once belonged to Fellwren himself.

                  <br/><br/>
                  With some things on your to-do list you split up, Vincent went to meet with Arc and learn about his company, and the
                  rest of you went for a quick afternoon drug deal. Vincent you explored through the workshops of Arc’s building, and he
                  showed you one of his newest projects, a massive defense unit that bugged out, threatening to tear down you and the
                  building with it. Upon seeing your skill Arc took you upstairs and offered you an office that that could belong to
                  you, a place to hang your hat and make an honest living. With your friends and your life on the line you denied the
                  offer, instead preparing equipment that would help you take down The Realmsweepers. The rest of you met with Jonas, a
                  Goliath drug dealer that frequents Jerren’s tavern, to buy weed, and also to gather some info. Jonas points you in the
                  direction of a group that goes by the name of The Garbagemen. The group is known to be able to get folks off of Terron
                  in a pinch, but he warned you, don’t call until you're ready they act fast.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The night was winding down, the sun was setting, and you had seemingly made it through your first night on the run
                  from a powerful family and corporation. You almost managed to escape them, but you forgot one thing. The company
                  calling cards in your pockets all chimed, and you knew you had been tracked here. Elias and Astrid were outside with
                  two guards, and evidence of your betrayal, along with proof of the murder you committed when on Terterra. You were
                  given a choice. Hand over your weapons and stand down, or suffer the consequences… Team 23 never once backed down from
                  a fight. As Elias left the scene, counter spelling a weak attempt at stopping him, Astrid’s mind games began. Pulling
                  on your worst tragedies she dug into the minds of your sorcerer and monk, but with wills as strong as steel they
                  snapped themselves out of it, desperate to stay in the fight. The guards fell one, and then the other. All that
                  remained was Astrid Realmsweeper, and soon she too fell. If only she had stayed down. Rising in her place was a
                  twisted monster, her words ringing out loudly in the streets “She may have turned us into a monster, but he made us
                  royalty” The four armed twisted aspect of Astrid fought relentlessly, her claws digging into Fellwren chest as the
                  heroic Edith jumped to his rescue giving Fellwren the energy and lifeforce he needed to finish her off.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 10: A Journey Through Space</h3>
              <p>Session Ten begun staring down the corpse of a mutilated Astrid Realmsweeper, her blood still staining your clothes.
                  The billboards across town turned a dark scarlet red, screening your face, and the words “Wanted Killers: 5000 GP For
                  Information.” You ditched your calling cards in place of some burner phones Jerren had, and promptly made a call to
                  The Garbagemen.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The Garbagemen got you off of the planet, but it wasn’t direct transport, you had two days to spend in Duon before you
                  reached Terterra. Rather that wait it out drunk and asleep, you set out to right a few wrongs from Vincent’s past. The
                  Orphanage. A terrible organization run by a man named Tanish, known for adopting kids and pitting them against each
                  other. A long time ago two of these kids grew close, bonded by their kindness and generosity. Striving for more, the
                  one of them made a plan, fake his own death and escape, returning to save the other. That kid was Vincent. He didn’t
                  ever return though, instead living out his days as a medic experimenting with various forms of healing on the lowlifes
                  of Duon. Where Vincent strived Vangelis struggled, forced to work for the very man who made his childhood hell.
                  Confronted with this horrible truth Vincent tracked down Tanish, ending his life with an acid arrow through the neck.
                  JJ posted men outside the orphanage for a fee, and Vincent swore to return and right his predecessor’s wrongs.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You had more pressing matters on another planet, Terterra. Kita had been sending you message after message that he
                  couldn’t hold out the attack much longer, and that he needed you there to help. You made your way to Terterra and
                  fought your way away from the portal, heading straight to The Blades Dungeon. Kita let you in and the Tiqan people
                  prepared for a forward assault. It never came… Falling from the sky were hundreds of small metal tubes, with bright
                  red lights blinking, faster and faster and faster.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 11: The Boon</h3>
              <p>This session began in a fireball of death, waves of explosions rolled across the countryside towards you, ending your
                  lives as it did. You were met in the afterlife by Mystra. Mystra showed you the past, a sad tale of a family on the
                  brink of death, until their mother performed a ritual to grant them undending life. The ritual nearly killed Mystra,
                  shattering her body and scattering it across the planes, to one day turn into the very weapons you now wield. She
                  upgraded your gear, and rewound the clock, sending you back to Ellcom’s headquarters where the attack originated.

                  <br/><br/>
                  After fighting your way up to the top floor, you found him. Gideon Realmsweeper with his back turned, ready to drop
                  the attack to end the Tiqan people. The fight raged, fireballs were thrown and counterspelled, telekenesis was used to
                  toss you around and towards your death, until Gideon fell. Rising in his place was a twisted dual sword wielding
                  monster, who threatened to end your lives. After landing the killed blow, you rigged the explosives to detonate the
                  headquarters of this godforsaken company, once you had safely escaped the planet.

                  <br/><br/>
                  A phone call from Jerren ruined your plans, something about Fellwren’s mother, he needed to see him.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You split up, Vincent and Ea went to meet the garbagemen and start the journey home, Fellwren and Edith went to see
                  Jerren. Elias was sat in his bar, wanting to have a conversation. Edith went outside, Fellwren blockaded the doors,
                  and when they finally reopened he lay dead in his fathers arms.
                  <br/><br/></p>

              <h3>Session 12: The Funeral</h3>
              <p>This session was a mournful one, your friend was lowered into the ground after months spent fighting by your side. In
                  his place his brother came to join you and fight for his vengeance. His funeral was beautiful, mementos were left
                  around his grave sight in all forms, but unfortunately the day was interrupted by the rising of the dead. You
                  travelled to Terterra to meet with Kita and get to the bottom of things. This is where you left Vincent. Vincent had
                  other matters to attend to, so once again, a hard goodbye was had.

                  <br/><br/>
                  On Terterra you met Anima, a native to Terterra whose village was recently attacked by a horde of undead foe, and you
                  promised to help him after learning how chill of a dude he was. Village Scythia was overwhelmed. Skeletons and zombies
                  roamed the streets, clobbering at you any chance they got, never ceasing to continue fighting. Finally, you reached
                  the center of town, and saw Anima’s uncle, struggling to fight off the masses and protect what remained of his
                  village. You fought towards the top of the hill, and watched him fall, immediately failing two death saves. Edith’s
                  insane movement got to him in no time and brought him back up, and you found victory. It turns out Anima’s uncle was a
                  member of the original blades, and passed his arrow to Anima to carry out the prophecy.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 13: The Journey to Forndor</h3>
              <p>The Blades returned to home base, convening with Kita to gather intel on a peculiar remnant of the undead onslaught
                  that took place in Scythia. Kita examined the bony hand of a felled skeletal warlock, sensing to his despair fiendish
                  energy as well as the expected necrotic. He painted a picture for you of the realms of both Mystra and her brother
                  Helm, his explanation aided by information Ea was able to dig up from the tome she had previously snagged. Helm’s
                  Realm existed in a separate dimension from that of Mystra’s, allowing for an individual doorway on his side to have
                  near infinite exits in this world. This meant the door could only be closed from the other side. You hatched a plan to
                  travel to the nine hells and put a stop to whichever Archdevil had started this war, with an ingredients list you set
                  out for the first of four, the tooth of a formidable dragon.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The Journey to Forndor had many hiccups, the first before you ever left for sea, a risen soldier from a war fought
                  long before Ellcom’s arrival strode proudly down the canyon road. Confused as if dealing with ptsd he spoke from two
                  different pasts, one of war and valor, the other torture and orders. “I… I was sent back to destroy these” He said to
                  you referencing your adamantine weapons. Instead of fighting this confused fallen soldier, you rendered him harmless,
                  showing him compassion instead of the violence he was used to, and in turn sent his soul to rest.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You set sail, Anima and Edith quickly burning through their weed supply, and the water you brought as well, which was
                  easily fixed with some purification from Lyren. You came across an island under attack from strange six legged
                  monsters, their skin falling off from reanimation as well. A lone frog person had survived the attack. You saved them,
                  and found in return a friend, and a small piece of adamantine.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You continued, the next week uneventful, until you approached the shores of Forndor. The ice forced you to continue on
                  foot, leaping from iceberg to iceberg, fighting a killer whale along the way. Finally, you arrived, the cold winds
                  raising the hairs on your neck, your frog friend fighting for his life against the cold. This barren wasteland of ice
                  and snow revealed secrets of its own, hidden amongst the stacks of ice was a small town, Bremen. The townsfolk were
                  kind if not a bit strange, revealing the dragons were locked away, the only one that could allow you even close to
                  their mountain was Speaker Crannoc of Caer - Dineval.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Your host for the night was one Cora Mulphoon, who told you of how she lost her son Huarwar, and you put together that
                  the castle his potential captors spoke of must be the same one you now head to. Your journey requires a stop in
                  Goodmead, so you have your next destination, you awake to Cora cooking you a warm breakfast to send you off, and that,
                  is where we are now.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 14: Black Teeth in the Spine</h3>
              <p>You marched out of Bremen, in hunt for a truly formidable dragon’s tooth. Your journey took you through the small
                  town of Good Mead, whose name was found to be quite ironic, as they were in fact out of mead. You split off from the
                  beaten path in search of the stolen goods, finding them stashed by a Verbeeg in what looked to be an old chieftains
                  burial ground. After slaying the creatures that dwelled within you desecrated an ancient tomb, Ea’s desire for power
                  and to “be the best” getting to her, her selfish desires cursing her with nightmares, and a growing lack of control.
                  A righteously adept Lyren saved the day with a clutch protection from good and evil, and after returning the mead you
                  all celebrated.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Your second day of travel was to Caer-Dineval, and besides the small owl bear ambush, you made it unscathed. You
                  discovered the Caer to be overrun with Tieflings, but not the super rad hero Tieflings, the terrible culty
                  Tieflings. A townsfolk told you of the visions she had received of the future, and your coming, and prepared you for
                  what was to come. An unfortunate turn of events combined with the discovery of a lost son, as well as an imprisoned
                  Speaker Crannoc, turned into an all out bloodbath, with Cones of Cold, Counterspells, and Casualties. With the cult
                  all but wiped out, and the key to your victory in hand, it seemed all was well.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Anima, overrun with anger and a need for order was acting strangely, and in an attempt to gain an advantage in the
                  dragon fight “no matter the cost” ripped the amulet from Huarwar’s neck, causing ice to form around his throat, as he
                  faded out of consciousness. A lucky move saved him, but something was wrong with Anima, he wasn’t acting himself. Ea
                  quickly grabbed the amulet from him, and smashed it, breaking the curse.

                  <br/><br/>
                  With the aid of Huarwar’s amulet you marched to The Spine, using it as a key to open the door where you faced The
                  Frostmaiden. In the words of Vincent, you fucked it in the butt.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The payday was incredible, scoring you I believe a total of 1800 gold, one really sick blue gem, and two spell
                  scrolls, one a fourth level, and one a fifth level.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The cutscene end to the session rolled as Huarwar was reunited with his mother, and Huarwar was reunited with you,
                  his friends, and you sailed merrily back to The Blades Dungeon. Reunited with Kita, you put some pieces together with
                  the help of Ea’s Tome, by the way the title is “Codex of The Anointed; Author Unknown”.

                  <br/><br/>
                  As you read through a passage about the nine hells, you came to one with a note scribbled next to it, Fellwren
                  question mark? The fifth layer of hell, Stygia, ran by one Levistus. An icy wasteland built upon a frozen ocean,
                  holding the great city of Tantlin. Could this Levistus be the one sending souls through to Mystra’s realm? Are they
                  perhaps the true Frostmaiden? What does Fellwren have to do with it?
                  <br/><br/></p>

              <div id = "Hell"></div>
              <h3>Session 15: An Infernal Princeps</h3>
              <p>This session was a long one. You all spent some time gathering supplies, getting new clothes that fit your
                  destination, as well as an innumerable amount of potions to hopefully keep you alive on your journey. Goodbyes were
                  said, including one from Lyren to Jillian (the cute blonde who ran the market at Camp Malovia) that read “TTYL, go to
                  hell!” Once settled Kita brought you all to a clearing deep in the Kreiss Clan’s forest, where he would perform the
                  ritual that would take you into Helm’s Realm.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Your unknown foe had other plans though, and in an effort to stop you from reaching their location, they sent waves of
                  undead through to attempt to stop your ritual efforts. You acted quickly: fixing the spell even as it was in motion,
                  protecting Kita and helping him complete the connection, and finally you succeeded, the portal opening up in the
                  ground for you. Kita had told you prior that the spell required you to piggyback off of the death of another, and in
                  your last moments among Mystra’s creations, you learned that Kita would be the final sacrifice.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The fall to hell is a long one, causing Edith quite a bit of damage. But once you were all healed up you stopped to
                  take in your surroundings. Here is where you met Lulu. After a lot of arguing Lulu led you to her boss, Mad Maggie,
                  with whom you made a deal that you would find, and eliminate a rival warlord known as Princeps Kovic. She geared you
                  up with a Demon Grinder, an infernal war machine of grand design, and a few soul coins to power it. Off you went.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Any warlord worth his stock in Avernus has a well fortified and well defended base of operations. Kovic was no
                  exception. You barreled your war machine into its gates, destroying them with its wrecking ball. Within his fortress
                  Kovic stood proudly, wielding chains of various lengths, and slashing out at you with them. Edith sprinted boldly,
                  leaping over rivers of magma to reach his target, and then. He slipped. His jump didn’t get him far enough, leaving
                  him dangling over the edge, his feet burning in the lava below. Princeps leaped on him, one of his chains wrapping
                  around Edith’s throat and killing him, another descending to finish the job. With two failed death saves Edith began
                  hearing voices. Devil’s offering to help him, if he was only willing to make a deal and bring them the blue gem. He
                  refused, and in a flash Ea teleported the beefy boy Lyren alongside her to save Edith’s life. The fight that ensued
                  was one for the books but it ended with all four of The Ember Blades surviving.

                  <br/><br/>
                  A lot is going on with our heroes in this leg of the journey. Ea has begun getting messages from her father. Is he
                  down here in Hell? Anima has begun to once again lose control of his impulses, leaving his last words to Kita ones of
                  hate and judgement. Is he going to be a liability? Edith’s guilt over Fellwren’s death has led to nightmares invading
                  his nightly trances, and he seems triggered by the literal blood on his hands and even Fellwren’s name. Is he ever
                  going to be able to forgive himself? Lyren who has sworn to heal has once again picked up a blade in the name of
                  vengeance. Is this path of destruction leading right to his own psyche?
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 16: The Wandering Emporium</h3>
              <p>Fresh off a victory with Princeps Kovic, The Blades tore down The River Styx in search of The Bleeding Citadel, and
                  the gate to the second layer. Your timing was horrible, traveling at the same time as one of Zariel’s greatest
                  trophies, the demon Crokek’toeck, (Pronounced Crow-kek-toe-ick) a massive amphibious monster who dwarfed even the
                  River Styx. You fucked it in the butt.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Your journey had you meeting a few other character’s along the way, Horatio Hiddlewaithe, a vain and rich man whose
                  soul wasn’t quite heavy enough with sin to drag him into The River Styx, and Gramma Valor, a traveling saleswoman that
                  heavily resembled Mad Maggie. You stocked up on gear and went on your merry way.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Your final destination was the great Wandering Emporium, within which you beheld an encounter between demons and
                  devils. The Horrible Demon Krull and his band of monsters threatened Mahadi the Smuggler to take them into the second
                  layer to which he refused. You cleared the shopping center, granting you a discount, and also the trust of your host.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You put this trust to use quickly, asking questions about previous traveler - specifically one Burrow of Duon, a man
                  who still remains mysterious. Your host Mahadi vaguely remembered him, but not as well as he did the other mortal who
                  came before you. A douchey blonde haired prick, who dragged with him a cloaked and bound soul. Was this Elias
                  Realmsweeper? Could your belief that this adventure was unconnected from your previous in fact be wrong?
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 17: The Iron City of Dis</h3>
              <p>This session you delved through The Iron Mines surrounding the Iron City of Dis, in search of passage to the third
                  layer. You snuck past the Devil Foreman and his mining crew, and made your trek through the vast expanses of open
                  landscape that is The Second Layer of Hell. Thoughts flooded your minds, threatening to break your spirits and your
                  souls, but conversation amongst friends kept you sane.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The City surrounded you on every side, brutalist towers stretching up like bars on a prison cell to bind you here. A
                  flash of green pulled you aside. A friendly face long ago lost to the afterlife. Fellwren? You find your friend in The
                  Garden’s of Elysium, chatting it up with your old mentor Kita. The truth however was much darker, as these were only
                  crude visages meant to drag you into the Torturer’s den. As the nectar-like aroma washed over you your eyes grew
                  heavy, and the multi-eyed snaked devil crept into your minds.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Lyren, a white knight with a dream of healing the wounded and saving his brother, was forced to face the harsh truth
                  of where he comes from. A “military man” who was in fact a hired killer. A list of kills longer than his blade, the
                  two people at the top a kid that reminds him of his brother, and a pregnant woman who reminds him of his mother.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Ea, a neglected child’s outburst left her parent-less. Lost to the world only to be found by a corrupt corporation.
                  Her teacher and “caretaker” a manipulative employee that kept her locked in her room. Her “friends” at the compound
                  didn't adore her they loathed her. Now her family, the Ember Blades, are falling apart.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Anima, the young protégé and future leader of The Village Scythia, losing his innocence to the horrors of the world
                  day by day. His cravings of vengeance held back by a paper thin wall. The amulets found in Forndor still retaining
                  their hold on his soul.

                  <br/><br/>
                  And finally Edith, our fun-loving stoner, and acrobatics extraordinaire. His only goal to give good times to any and
                  all. His old crush dead because of his efforts, his old friend dead because the lack thereof. Forced to watch them die
                  just as they once did, and forced to watch his party die the way that they one day might.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Your torture sunk deeper, leaving you in a cavern the size of a baseball field. The four of you split up by a massive
                  pillar rising up in the center of the room, along which the faces of those used to torture you climbed, clambered, and
                  slid around.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 18: The Casino</h3>
              <p>We joined our party deep in the dreamscape of the torturer, an eldritch aberration whose “soul” purpose was to
                  torture those within Dispater’s realm. You all went head to head with your own personal hell. Anima stared down the
                  shaft of an arrow, much like the ones he fires off at his own enemies, forced to confront the dark side of himself
                  that has been slowly corrupting his brain. Lyren once again had to face his previous wrongdoings, confronted by the
                  familiar brother he once felled, and his mother’s crying face blaming him for her death. Ea was judged by her former
                  teacher, questioning why she was so dirty, and disheveled. Edith was met with the face of his lost friend, and his old
                  crush, two people he let die.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Something clicked last session. Anima you realized you are not your dark side, and your willingness to die in order to
                  smother that part of yourself shook it to its core, freeing you from its grasp even if only for the time being. Edith
                  you don’t “let” your friends die, you rush to the frontline to stand and fight for them, whenever the chance arises.
                  Lyren, you have done awful horrible things, but your mother left you. You had no one but Jerren to raise you, and we
                  have previous experience to show how well that works out. The three boys together heal a little bit at a time, and
                  acknowledge their wrongdoings and desire to help others.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Ea. As your friends fight off their demons, and their dark sides, you realize that while alongside them, you’ve been
                  fighting off yours as well. There is power in darkness, and for a moment you gave yourself over to yours, this
                  infernal side of you that has been reaching out. You’re determined to be the best, no matter the cost.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You faded from this place, searching through the dungeon to find some information. Within the torturer’s space, you
                  found a note in a journal detailing how “information is traded alongside gold and souls at the casino,” as well as a
                  letter.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The Letter:
              </p>
              <p class="bullets">

                  It was foolish to allow the previous traveler to breach into the third. Rumor has it he made a deal with “5” that
                  might shift the power out of balance. Don’t make the same mistake with these four, but don’t kill them right away
                  either. I’m having fun watching their tribulations.

                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 19: The Prison of Mentiri</h3>
              <p>We began this session in intense social politics, an overgrown devil named Grange sat at a table of girls that seemed
                  to be in his service. You joined him in a game of cards, slowly earning his goodwill, and eventually through a few
                  good hands earned yourself some information. Through his girls you discovered that one of Dispater's lieutenants was
                  thrown into the Prison of Mentiri for helping "the cute blonde guy", and after pressing Grange he told you more about
                  the place including directions.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Ea requested some information supposedly based off of something she read in the book, about the Lord of the Fourth,
                  Belial. Grange scoffed, informing you that the actual Lord of the Fourth was Fierna, Bel's daughter, and told you that
                  Belial was removed from his position after his daughter Fierna informed Asmodeus of the overthrow attempt Belial was
                  trying to make.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You raced to the prison and scouted it out, gaining key insight into the guards on duty with the help of Anima's
                  detect magic, as well as a potential location of Alocer the lieutenant. The dogs and guards out front were quickly
                  taken out, and you raced into the Den of the Jailor.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 20: Dispater's Gate</h3>
              <p>We set off session twenty amidst a tense combat with the Jailor, a massive flying skeletal monstrosity that tore into
                  you with strategic combat maneuvers, and environmental effects, but once again, The Ember Blades prevail. Your efforts
                  awarded you with an informant, one of Dispater's own lieutenants, Alocer. The five of you signed a devil deal,
                  agreeing to help each other to the third layer, and then part ways.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Resting up for the night there was time for some conversation. Lyren you received almost beyond a doubt confirmation
                  that Elias' prisoner was in fact your long lost brother Fellwren, and then you and Anima took some time to reconnect
                  with your goddess Mystra.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You streamlined towards the Iron Tower, ready to charge through Dispater's portal, the only thing in your way a small
                  army of his foot soldiers. The mage has been taken out, along with a large chunk of the soldiers.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 21: The Bogs of Minauros</h3>
              <p>This session we arrived on the third layer of Hell, Minauros. The poisoned aberrant bogs surrounded you on every
                  side, as an oily acid rain began to fall. Time froze, as a repeat caller made a connection with our sorceress Ea.
                  Balkazar Creed lent more of his power to Ea, and instructed her to travel to the Labyrinth of Truth, where the stories
                  of every traveler of The Nine Hells was stored.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You escaped the acid rain, and moved on to the sinking city, a fetid cesspit of ever crumbling buildings and
                  infuriating devils. Here you made a new ally, or at least a new acquaintance - Ontairon. You learned the location of
                  The Labyrinth of Truth - a tower in the center of The Jangling Hiter, and you also learned the supposed way to reach
                  the fourth layer - (country bumpkin voice) "Yeah you just gotta sink, just sink right down go fallin through to the
                  next layer"

                  <br/><br/>
                  We find you now on the edge of some twisted version of Ea and Lyren's hometown, Eview. Ontairon is sat aback the
                  draconic spirit Ea has summoned, and the Ellcom tower loams over you in the distance.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 22: The Labyrinth of Truth</h3>
              <p>Session Twenty Two, you delved into the Jangling City of Eview, a twisted and distorted version of the Capitol of
                  Terron. First stop? Jared's Bar, where you all had quite the familiar little encounter. In a funny homage to Session
                  Nine of this campaign, you saved Jared from some thugs, who demanded he owed them money. You killed them for Jared,
                  with the promise of free drink, food, and room for the night.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Lyren took this opportunity to do a walkthrough of his old home, his main attraction being Fellwren's room. Jerren's
                  bar brings back numerous memories for Lyren, but it brought a new memory to him as well, one that was not his own. The
                  night of Fellwren's death, he sat across from his father, who had tears streaming down his face. One final thought
                  filled Fellwren's head "He was a shitty dad, but he was my dad". Lyren spiraled into a pit of fear and despair, the
                  memories of his own wrongdoings and failures overwhelming him, only to be brought back from the brink by the people
                  who he now calls his family.

                  <br/><br/>
                  After a sweet moment you headed out, making way for Ellcom Tower; where Ea would take her turn facing an awful past.
                  Childhood in the Sorcery Core was clearly no good, but Ea has never been able to fully grasp that until this visit
                  here. A child's memories flooded into an adult's mind, forcing Ea to her knees. Lyren was able to return the favor he
                  previously received, and in turn bring her back from the brink.

                  <br/><br/>
                  With vigor and a newly deepened bond you snuck to the tower, working out the keys to each floor as you went. A flood
                  of information was spilled which is heavily detailed in the discord, but I will give you the SparkNotes here.</p>

              <p class="bullets">
                  - Fierna, Belial's first daughter, was the one who made the original plan to overthrow Asmodeus, not Belial himself.
                  Belial was playing the role of the good father, and just wanted his daughter to have anything she desired - in this
                  case it was power. This role of the good father and the provider now extends to Ea, who also desires nothing more than
                  power. The automaton who runs the place informed you that the consequences she is experiencing were an unintended side
                  effect.
                  <br/><br/>
                  - Stygia is ruled by Levistus, who has recently made a powerful deal with Elias Realmsweeper: He would attack the
                  mortal realm, in exchange for Elias' soul. If anything were to happen to either of them the deal is to be considered
                  null and void. Levistus uses the Frostmaiden when he needs a Corporeal vessel.
                  <br/><br/>
                  - Burrow has been sent to the sixth layer, Malbolge.
                  <br/><br/>
                  - Fellwren is chained up by his wrists in the tower that Elias resides in, his soul belonging to Elias
                  <br/><br/>
                  - There are six books on Quarth, that can push a mortal to demigod levels.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 23: The Fires of Plethegos</h3>
              <p>The Ember Blades took the plunge into The Bogs of Minauros, allowing yourselves to sink through to the fourth layer,
                  and plummet to The Flames of Plethegos, where Ea's father Balkazar awaited. He was… unexpectedly kind. In a touching
                  introduction Balkazar explained to you all that he wasn't the one who had been corrupting Ea, but rather an outside
                  force had been tainting the power she was receiving. Could it have been Asmodeus? All the same, Balkazar just wished
                  to be a good father to Ea, and give her what she desired most… Power.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The middle ground was found in the form of upgrades to all of your artifacts, Infernal Iron, which was to Helm as
                  Adamantine was to Mystra. You all received buffs to your gifts from Mystra, granting everyone +2 on their primary
                  rolls. Balkazar also kitted out Ea's calling card with a new chip that allows it to communicate across planes.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You charged through Fierna's volcano, ripping past the fire giant and her dwarven minions, eventually taking the
                  plunge to Stygia.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Ember Blades, Hell has officially frozen over.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 24: Rime of The Frostmaiden</h3>
              <p>We started session twenty-four ass first on the fifth layer, immediately in the heat of battle with two drakes and an
                  Aboleth. You guys, having just left the fourth layer, were still injured and low on spells from the fight with the
                  fire giant, but you managed to prevail. After looting through the ship nearby you gained information about Spine
                  Tower, where Levistus once hid out from Asmodeus, and thought that might be where Elias and Fellwren are holed up.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You traveled to a nearby town, and with the help of an odd innkeeper, and Ea's pa-pa, had all the info you needed to
                  head out. One enemy stood in your way before your final fight, The Frostmaiden. A long and DANGEROUS fight ended with
                  I think 5 or 6 different knockdowns, but lucky for us no deaths. Most importantly, Anima got his sweet sweet freedom
                  from the Frostmaiden, and we have retired the restraint table for good.
                  <br/><br/></p>


              <h3>Session 25: A Tale of Two Brothers</h3>
              <p>If you have made it this far you are undoubtedly one of my beloved players, and friends. I just want to thank each of
                  you for being there with me on this journey, and helping me tell this incredible story.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You are all loved, and I wouldn't be where I was without you.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Now then lets get into our last recap shall we?

                  <br/><br/>
                  Session Twenty Five was the culmination of over a year of effort. A small group who set out to earn some coin and
                  respect now charges the fifth layer of hell to avenge their fallen comrade, and put a stop to the evil who is Elias
                  Realmsweeper. You took on the battlefields of Avernus, besting Princeps Kovic and his band of devils. You endured the
                  Tortures of Dis, outwitting Dispater himself with the help of his own lieutenant. The shoes on your feet have dredged
                  through the Bogs of Minauros, as you deciphered Mammon's Labyrinth of Truth. Your bodies cooked navigating The Fires
                  of Plethegos, besting Fierna's Guardian. One layer left… Stygia.

                  <br/><br/>
                  You found your mark across the great glacial seas. Elias Realmsweeper. You raced across the crumbling landscape,
                  outrunning Asmodeus' attempts to rid The Nine Hells of your presence. A Tale of Two Brothers, baring down on one
                  another atop a rope bridge. A newly freed ranger seeking to prove himself in battle. Our sorceress scorned looking to
                  settle an old score. Oh and Ontairon! Together you launched a frontal assault on Spine Tower, where Elias was
                  cowering, and just as the fabric of this reality faded away, you finished him. The killing blow delivered by the very
                  sorceress Elias helped create.

                  <br/><br/>
                  With his oath fulfilled, Lyren retired, taking over Jerren's bar. He lived a good life, slowly converting the place
                  into a less morally questionable affair. He fell in love with a beautiful woman named Macy, and though they would have
                  no children of their own, the two would over time take in many of the wayward souls Mystra's realm had within it.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Anima, fully matured and ready to take over his village, returned home. With the help of Iris Realmsweeper and her
                  assistant Steven, Anima would lead Terterra into a new age of knowledge. He sought to educate the people of his home
                  planet, and unite them once more under a common cause. The Blades were no longer about war and protection, no under
                  Anima's guidance they would become a symbol of hope and peace.

                  <br/><br/>
                  The one remaining original member of Team 23, Ea Creed. Ea lived a hard life, one that was unfair to no fault of her
                  own, but she never let it stop her. She persevered at every turn, destined to be the best sorceress to ever touch
                  Mystra's realm. With the help of her dad Balkazar Creed, former Lord of The Fourth, Ea would train for years. She
                  learned the ways of magic not from a studied caster this time, but an innate one like herself. She would learn from
                  the truest of Patrons - her own father.

                  <br/><br/>
                  Mystra and Helm's stories are not over, and neither is our beloved Ea's, but it is time for this chapter of our story
                  to come to a close. Thank you my friends, for helping me put on such a damn good show.
