              <h2>Mystra</h2>
              <h3>Goddess of Life, Magic, and More</h3>
              <p>
                  Mystra is The Mother of All Magic, The Lady of Might, and The Creator of All Things. Her greatest creation
                  is life itself. There are six different planets in Mystra's Realm: Terron, Duon, Terterra, Qarth,
                  Fent, and Genus. Each one of them is flush with life, and each one tells their own story.

              <div id = "Terron"></div>
              <h2>Terron</h2>
              <h3>Home of The Realmsweepers</h3>
              <p>
                  Terron is a beautiful planet, but it has not always been that way. As technology advanced over the
                  years, peoples lives were extended, and the population boomed. Villages expanded to towns and
                  eventually cities, that threatened to envelope one another. People began fighting, and society
                  threatened to burn itself to the ground. Until Ellcom. Thanks to Ellcom Terron now has affordable
                  low impact housing, a booming economy, and a 79% recovered environment.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Ellcom’s headquarters and the realmsweeper manor reside in Eview, a metropolitan city that many of the
                  wealthy Terron’s call home. Near Eview are a few suburban towns, home to many of Ellcom’s employees.
                  <br/><br/>
              </p>

              <div id = "Duon"></div>
              <h2>Duon</h2>
              <h3>One Man's Trash is Another Man's Treasure</h3>
              <p>
                  Duon is what’s known as an Ecumenopolis, a city that spans the surface of an entire planet. When it
                  was first imagined, Duon was meant to house some of the overpopulation that was occurring on Terron,
                  an attempt by Ellcom to fix an escalating problem. Unfortunately the fix was short-lived. As people
                  from Terron were shipped over to Duon, the lack of space was simply transferred to another planet.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The streets of Duon are covered in trash and a large population of homeless. Homes are not houses and
                  skyscrapers but rather resemble cargo containers with windows stacked haphazardly on top of one
                  another. With the transfer of people Ellcom also began to dispose of excess waste on Duon, promising
                  to recycle it into new homes and future products. The reuse project never made it off the ground.
                  <br/><br/>
              </p>

              <div id = "Terterra"></div>
              <h2>Terterra</h2>
              <h3>Land of Nature and Opportunity</h3>
              <p>
                  This planet shares a special connection with Mystra, the weave is strong here and has a history of
                  causing unexpected outbursts. Beautiful deciduous forests form a ring around the equator, quickly
                  giving way to bleak deserts, and icy wastelands at the north and south poles. Visitors have mentioned
                  sightings of dragons unlike any discovered in the past, and rumors have been circulating about Giants
                  living high above in the clouds.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Terterra is a planet recently saved from capitalist greed by the glorious heroes known as The Ember Blades.
                  Terterra was to be the latest victim of Ellcom's schemes, and is only around today thanks to our
                  Heroes. Terterra is full of life, and was the birthplace of the legendary group known as "The Blades".
                  <br/><br/>
              </p>

              <div id = "Qarth"></div>
              <h2>Qarth</h2>
              <h3>A Twisted Tale of Good VS Evil</h3>
              <p>
                  Drifting deep in the furthest expanses of Mystra's realm, is a planet known only as Qarth. Shrouded
                  in evil and war for decades Qarth is not a land of peace and prosperity like our home Terron, nor a
                  land of nature and opportunity like the beloved Terterra, but rather a tumultuous landscape of good vs
                  evil conveniently divided by darkness and light. Qarth rotates slowly, casting one side of its globe
                  into eternal shadow, and the other into eternal daylight.
                  <br/><br/>
                  From the dark side of the world rules The Tyrant of Twilight, Empress Morana, intent on taking over
                  Qarth and ruling it as the one true Queen. Her influence is felt deep into the Lands of Light, as her
                  magic and her armies of monstrous soldiers find their ways through the cracks in its defenses. Little
                  is known of the dark side, as the forces of Light have never been on the offensive, but the select few
                  who make it back from the border weave sickening stories.
                  <br/><br/>
                  On the light side of the world sits Queen Saraphon, Lady of Light. Her forces stretch thin, and pale
                  in comparison to those of Morana, but the will of the people of Qarth is strong. Queen Saraphon is
                  merely the most recent head of the Lands of Light, one more in a long line of leaders unable to do
                  more than delay Morana.
