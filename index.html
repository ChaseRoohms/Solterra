              <h2>The Twins</h2>
              <h3> Mystra and Helm</h3>
              <p>
                  As a goddess, Mystra could shape change at will and mortals who saw her reported she changed
                  constantly. Others described her appearing in a form resembling a multicolored will-o'-wisp. Mystra
                  is The Mother of All Magic, The Lady of Might, and The Creator of All Things. Her greatest creation
                  is life itself. There are six different planets in Mystra's Realm: Terron, Duon, Terterra, Qarth,
                  Fent, and Genus. Each one of them is flush with life, and each one tells their own story.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Mystra had a brother, Helm; the two were opposites. Helm has always appeared as a tall man
                  (14-20 feet) clad in full plate armor, the faceplate of his Helm concealing his face. A very old
                  deity, Helm was the eternal sentry and was always seen wearing a full suit of armor that represented
                  the weight of his heavy responsibility. Helm's responsibility was the ending of life. As mortals grow
                  old, and gain power, they corrupt, the mortal soul was never meant to live an undying life.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Mystra created, and Helm destroyed, an ouroboros constantly spinning. Eventually Mystra created
                  something she didn't want to see the world rid of, life. The shear uniformity of inanimate objects
                  makes their loss meaningless, a stone is a stone no matter how many times it has to be remade, but
                  life has a way of forming differently each and every time around. Mystra was inspired by it. Each time
                  Helm would take a creation from her before it lived to its full potential she wept for its loss, a
                  snowflake that would never form the same way again. The two made a deal, everything she created would
                  be destroyed by his hand, but only once it served its term in her realm. She created for him his own
                  realm, The Outer Planes. Just as Mystra had many worlds in her realm, so too did he. The
                  Nine Hells were reserved for the worst of Mystra's creations, but for those which he took pity on,
                  he maintained a peaceful place, Elysium, for them to spend their final moments.

              <div id = "Weave"></div>
              <h2>The Weave</h2>
              <h3>Magic or Mystra</h3>
              <p>
                  The Weave, an extradimensional flow of arcane energy, is the way through which raw magic is accessed,
                  tapped into and used by casters of magic. The Weave is the way in which magic presents itself to
                  beings for their use, and it flows throughout many of the worlds. It touches almost every corner of
                  existence, with the exception of dead-magic zones that exist on certain planets.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The Weave is a vague concept that is believed to be many things. Many divine casters believe it to be
                  Mystra's body, The Mother of All Magic. Arcane casters believe the weave to be a force of nature, the
                  very breath of the world itself. But to all the studies of casters, arcane and divine alike, it is the
                  source magic and the many energies and forces that exist across the Terras. Many see it as a "fabric"
                  on which magic is "drawn", and damaging the fabric causes magic to go awry. The term Weave has become
                  a synonym of the use of magic. Casting a spell is equivalent to telling the Weave to rearrange itself
                  to create an effect.

                  In a land of teleportation circles and plane shifting wizards, the logistics of space travel simply lose all importance. As scholarly wizards and diviners scoured their planet for all that was to be found, their eyes turned to the sky, reaching out to the stars with powerful arcane energy.

                  Oh, how they explored.

                  It is the year 3065 and life spans across three planets, linked together with teleportation circles scattered across the world, controlled and operated by an organization known as Ellcom; the very mages who opened these doorways so long ago.

              <h2>Heroes of Old</h2>
              <h3>The Blades</h3>
              <p>
                  Long ago, Mystra warned Terterra of the danger that would soon befall them. They bound together to
                  form a line of defense, using adamantine that Mystra herself scattered across the realms to forge weapons
                  that could kill the undying. Their mantra was simple: "For the day shall come when monsters from
                  another world arrive to slaughter. When their grunts lie dead of age or overwork, they still shall
                  reign, killed only by our blades." They called themselves The Blades.
                  <br/><br/>
                  They waited, prepared for an assault, an attack, any of the violence they had been warned of. Nothing.
                  The fear that was stricken into the heart of Terterra needed somewhere to go, and so its people turned
                  on one another. One by one the members of The Blades fell, and with them so did Mystra's warning.
                  <br/><br/>

              <h2>Monsters from Another World</h2>
              <h3>The Realmsweeper Family</h3>
              <p>
                  The Realmsweepers were a family born of tragedy. Many centuries ago, the planet Terron was in
                  ruins. Overpopulation led to rapid societal expansion that decimated the ecosystem that was once so
                  beautiful. Esther Realmsweeper - mother of six - in a last ditch attempt to save her family, pulled on
                  her connection with The Weave and bent it to her will. Esther died in this ritual, and in some ways
                  Mystra did too. Mystra's body was shattered into countless shards of adamantine, and spread across all
                  six of her planets. The one material capable of killing the now immortal Realmsweepers.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The eldest, Elias Realmsweeper, went on to start the most powerful company ever to touch the face of
                  Terron - Ellcom. Ellcom launched Terron into a new age with affordable compact housing, a plethora of
                  new jobs, and an environmental recovery plan that would rapidly restore the beauty of their planet.
                  Ellcom had another project though, The Expansion.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The Expansion is Ellcom's space exploration program with three goals: Explore, Discover, Expand.
                  That's what Elias made sure the press saw at least. Ellcom was in all actuality, The Realmsweeper's
                  insurance policy. Esther had made them immortal, but the threat of adamantine was still out there
                  in the stars somewhere, and Elias would stop at nothing to eradicate it.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Only three of the siblings participate in Ellcom's activities - Elias, Astrid, and Gideon. The other
                  three siblings, brothers Erik and Sten and sister Iris, are not involved in the family company, in
                  fact they adamantly detested Elias and what they had become. Eventually their resistance posed enough
                  of a threat that they would be taken care of - put into an arcane slumber until Elias deemed fit.

              <h3>The Ember Blades</h3>
              <p>
                  Expansion Team 23, one of over 50 haphazardly assembled teams of four sent to Terterra's surface in
                  the most recent iteration of The Expansion Project. Team 23 would quickly stumble upon one of
                  Terterra's native populations, The Tiqans. Their leader, Chief Kita, pleaded with Team 23 to keep
                  their location a secret, warning them of their employers evil ways. Thus began the beginning of the
                  end for Ellcom.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Chief Kita had belonged to The Blades ages ago, his adamantine dagger still hung draped around his
                  neck. With the help of his son he forged a new set of weapons for the party, ones that fit the modern
                  age. They emblazoned them with the fiery spirit, and arcane energy they all seemed to wield, and took
                  on a new mantle. They were no longer Team 23, they were The Ember Blades.
